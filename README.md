# basic-dApp
My first dApp built with ethers.js. <br />
mood.sol contains a basic smart contract written in solidity and index.html provides a way for users to interact with the deployed smart contract (on Goerli Testnet using Remix IDE). <br />
Contract Address:
```shell
0xbe4A0CA92A9f04D2c305d21B6f91FAa47EA8779B
```
